# Load Data into a Warehouse using T-SQL in Microsoft Fabric

This lab demonstrates how to load data into a Microsoft Fabric data warehouse using T-SQL. A data warehouse in Fabric provides a relational database for large-scale analytics with full SQL semantics, allowing for data insertion, updating, and deletion, unlike the read-only SQL endpoint of a lakehouse.

**Estimated Completion Time:** 30 minutes

**Note:** A Microsoft Fabric trial is required to complete this exercise.

## Prerequisites

* A Microsoft Fabric account with a trial enabled.

## Steps

### 1. Create a Workspace

1.  Navigate to the [Microsoft Fabric home page](https://app.fabric.microsoft.com/home?experience=fabric) in your browser and sign in with your Fabric credentials.
2.  In the left menu bar, select **Workspaces** (the icon looks like ðŸ—‡).
3.  Create a **New workspace** with a name of your choice. Ensure you select a licensing mode that includes Fabric capacity (Trial, Premium, or Fabric).
4.  Once the workspace is created, it should be empty.

### 2. Create a Lakehouse and Upload Files

1.  Select **+ New item** and create a new **Lakehouse** with a name of your choice.
2.  After a short time, an empty lakehouse will be created. Download the `sales.csv` file from [https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/dp-data/raw/main/sales.csv](https://github.com/MicrosoftLearning/dp-data/raw/main/sales.csv) to your local machine.
3.  Return to your lakehouse in the browser. In the **...** menu for the **Files** folder in the **Explorer** pane, select **Upload** and then **Upload files**.
4.  Upload the `sales.csv` file from your local computer to the lakehouse.
5.  After uploading, select **Files** and verify that `sales.csv` is visible.

### 3. Create a Table in the Lakehouse

1.  In the **...** menu for the `sales.csv` file in the **Explorer** pane, select **Load to tables**, and then **New table**.
2.  In the **Load file to new table** dialog, provide the following information:
    * **New table name:** `staging_sales`
    * **Use header for columns names:** Selected
    * **Separator:** `,`
3.  Select **Load**.

### 4. Create a Warehouse

1.  On the left menu bar, select **Create**.
2.  Under the **Data Warehouse** section on the **New** page, select **Warehouse**.
3.  Give your new warehouse a unique name of your choice.
    * **Note:** If the **Create** option is not visible, click the ellipsis (**...**) first.
4.  After a minute or so, your new warehouse will be created.

### 5. Create Fact Table, Dimensions, and View

1.  From your workspace, select the warehouse you created.
2.  In the warehouse toolbar, select **New SQL query**.
3.  Copy and run the following T-SQL query to create the `Sales` schema, `Fact_Sales`, `Dim_Customer`, and `Dim_Item` tables:

    ```sql
    CREATE SCHEMA [Sales]
    GO

    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.tables WHERE name='Fact_Sales' AND SCHEMA_NAME(schema_id)='Sales')
    	CREATE TABLE Sales.Fact_Sales (
    		CustomerID VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    		ItemID VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    		SalesOrderNumber VARCHAR(30),
    		SalesOrderLineNumber INT,
    		OrderDate DATE,
    		Quantity INT,
    		TaxAmount FLOAT,
    		UnitPrice FLOAT
    	);

    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.tables WHERE name='Dim_Customer' AND SCHEMA_NAME(schema_id)='Sales')
        CREATE TABLE Sales.Dim_Customer (
            CustomerID VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
            CustomerName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
            EmailAddress VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
        );

    ALTER TABLE Sales.Dim_Customer add CONSTRAINT PK_Dim_Customer PRIMARY KEY NONCLUSTERED (CustomerID) NOT ENFORCED
    GO

    IF NOT EXISTS (SELECT * FROM sys.tables WHERE name='Dim_Item' AND SCHEMA_NAME(schema_id)='Sales')
        CREATE TABLE Sales.Dim_Item (
            ItemID VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
            ItemName VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
        );

    ALTER TABLE Sales.Dim_Item add CONSTRAINT PK_Dim_Item PRIMARY KEY NONCLUSTERED (ItemID) NOT ENFORCED
    GO
    ```

    **Important:** Foreign key constraints are often omitted in data warehouses to optimize ETL performance.

4.  In the **Explorer** pane, navigate to **Schemas** Â» **Sales** Â» **Tables** to see the newly created tables. If they are not visible, refresh the **Tables** node.
5.  Open a new **New SQL query** editor.
6.  Copy and run the following query, replacing `<your lakehouse name>` with the actual name of your lakehouse, to create a view pointing to the staging table in the lakehouse:

    ```sql
    CREATE VIEW Sales.Staging_Sales
    AS
    SELECT * FROM [<your lakehouse name>].[dbo].[staging_sales];
    ```

7.  In the **Explorer** pane, navigate to **Schemas** Â» **Sales** Â» **Views** to see the `Staging_Sales` view.

### 6. Load Data to the Warehouse

1.  Create a new **New SQL query** editor.
2.  Copy and run the following T-SQL stored procedure to load data from the lakehouse into the warehouse tables:

    ```sql
    CREATE OR ALTER PROCEDURE Sales.LoadDataFromStaging (@OrderYear INT)
    AS
    BEGIN
    	-- Load data into the Customer dimension table
        INSERT INTO Sales.Dim_Customer (CustomerID, CustomerName, EmailAddress)
        SELECT DISTINCT CustomerName, CustomerName, EmailAddress
        FROM [Sales].[Staging_Sales]
        WHERE YEAR(OrderDate) = @OrderYear
        AND NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT 1
            FROM Sales.Dim_Customer
            WHERE Sales.Dim_Customer.CustomerName = Sales.Staging_Sales.CustomerName
            AND Sales.Dim_Customer.EmailAddress = Sales.Staging_Sales.EmailAddress
        );

        -- Load data into the Item dimension table
        INSERT INTO Sales.Dim_Item (ItemID, ItemName)
        SELECT DISTINCT Item, Item
        FROM [Sales].[Staging_Sales]
        WHERE YEAR(OrderDate) = @OrderYear
        AND NOT EXISTS (
            SELECT 1
            FROM Sales.Dim_Item
            WHERE Sales.Dim_Item.ItemName = Sales.Staging_Sales.Item
        );

        -- Load data into the Sales fact table
        INSERT INTO Sales.Fact_Sales (CustomerID, ItemID, SalesOrderNumber, SalesOrderLineNumber, OrderDate, Quantity, TaxAmount, UnitPrice)
        SELECT CustomerName, Item, SalesOrderNumber, CAST(SalesOrderLineNumber AS INT), CAST(OrderDate AS DATE), CAST(Quantity AS INT), CAST(TaxAmount AS FLOAT), CAST(UnitPrice AS FLOAT)
        FROM [Sales].[Staging_Sales]
        WHERE YEAR(OrderDate) = @OrderYear;
    END
    ```

3.  Create another new **New SQL query** editor.
4.  Copy and run the following query to execute the stored procedure and load data for the year 2021:

    ```sql
    EXEC Sales.LoadDataFromStaging 2021
    ```

    **Note:** You can modify the year parameter to load data from other years if available in the `sales.csv` file.

### 7. Run Analytical Queries

1.  On the top menu, select **New SQL query**.
2.  Copy and run the following query to see total sales by customer for 2021:

    ```sql
    SELECT c.CustomerName, SUM(s.UnitPrice * s.Quantity) AS TotalSales
    FROM Sales.Fact_Sales s
    JOIN Sales.Dim_Customer c
    ON s.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
    WHERE YEAR(s.OrderDate) = 2021
    GROUP BY c.CustomerName
    ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;
    ```

    **Note:** The top customer by total sales for 2021 is Jordan Turner with total sales of 14686.69.

3.  Open a new **New SQL query** or reuse the same editor and run the following query to see the top-selling items by total sales for 2021:

    ```sql
    SELECT i.ItemName, SUM(s.UnitPrice * s.Quantity) AS TotalSales
    FROM Sales.Fact_Sales s
    JOIN Sales.Dim_Item i
    ON s.ItemID = i.ItemID
    WHERE YEAR(s.OrderDate) = 2021
    GROUP BY i.ItemName
    ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;
    ```

    **Note:** The Mountain-200 bike model in black and silver were the top-selling items in 2021.

4.  Open a new **New SQL query** or reuse the same editor and run the following query to find the top customer for each product category (Bike, Helmet, Gloves) based on total sales in 2021:

    ```sql
    WITH CategorizedSales AS (
        SELECT
            CASE
                WHEN i.ItemName LIKE '%Helmet%' THEN 'Helmet'
                WHEN i.ItemName LIKE '%Bike%' THEN 'Bike'
                WHEN i.ItemName LIKE '%Gloves%' THEN 'Gloves'
                ELSE 'Other'
            END AS Category,
            c.CustomerName,
            s.UnitPrice * s.Quantity AS Sales
        FROM Sales.Fact_Sales s
        JOIN Sales.Dim_Customer c
        ON s.CustomerID = c.CustomerID
        JOIN Sales.Dim_Item i
        ON s.ItemID = i.ItemID
        WHERE YEAR(s.OrderDate) = 2021
    ),
    RankedSales AS (
        SELECT
            Category,
            CustomerName,
            SUM(Sales) AS TotalSales,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Category ORDER BY SUM(Sales) DESC) AS SalesRank
        FROM CategorizedSales
        WHERE Category IN ('Helmet', 'Bike', 'Gloves')
        GROUP BY Category, CustomerName
    )
    SELECT Category, CustomerName, TotalSales
    FROM RankedSales
    WHERE SalesRank = 1
    ORDER BY TotalSales DESC;
    ```

    **Note:** This query categorizes items based on their name and finds the top customer for each category. The category information is derived from the `ItemName` column.
